üß† Interests

1. Technology & Systems Integration
You‚Äôre deeply engaged in system-level customization and integration:

    Linux enthusiast (Ultramarine, Ubuntu, Zorin OS).

    Home automation with Home Assistant, integrating Piper (TTS) and Whisper (STT).

    SSH configurations and internal networking (e.g. custom hostnames, IP assignments).

    Use of Raspberry Pi for monitoring your network.

    Integration of smart systems in daily life (e.g. smart gas heater and hot water system).

2. Open-Source Tools & Development

    You favor self-hosted and open technologies: GIMP, LibreCAD, Pandas, Nginx, Wireshark, Ortho4XP, etc.

    You work with formats like .tflite, .onnx, and .hgt, and seem comfortable dealing with model files and AI tools.

    You automate workflows, manipulate file systems via terminal, and handle data with Python and spreadsheets.

3. Aviation & Simulation

    You have a strong interest in aviation, particularly realistic flight simulation (Airbus A320, A330, ToLiss models).

    Use of simulators like X-Plane on Linux/Steam.

    Enthusiastic about realism features like CPDLC, TCAS, LiveTraffic, and weather plugins.

4. Creative, DIY & Sustainability Projects

    You document nature (e.g. photographing a tree daily).

    You explore self-sufficiency ideas: water-based fireplaces with radiator heating, solar-geyser-gas hybrid systems.

    Business interest in beeswax products (natural wraps, leather care).

    House design (LibreCAD for plan tracing and scaling).

5. Web & Content Development

    You create and host multiple websites (Apache/Nginx).

    Use of WordPress for personal/business use (e.g. holiday rental and drone company sites).

    Interested in minimal and functional design (e.g. personal flying log/calendar with map-based route summaries).

üí° Ideas & Values

    Autonomy & Control: You prefer local and open-source solutions over cloud-dependent or proprietary ones.

    Practical Innovation: You combine modern tech (smart thermostats, machine learning, simulators) with real-world goals (comfort, efficiency, business).

    Sustainability & Efficiency: Your approach to heating, water, and product development reflects ecological awareness and optimization.

    Documentation & Analysis: From tree photos to flight logs and spreadsheets, you value organized tracking and reflective processes.

üßç‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Character Traits

    Curious & Analytical: You frequently ask how systems work, and you investigate deeply (e.g., Wireshark, flight data integration).

    Independent Thinker: You prefer doing things your way, often opting for custom setups over mainstream solutions.

    Problem Solver: You demonstrate resourcefulness in managing complex system setups and resolving integration issues.

    Creative & Observant: Your interests in photography, design, and custom dashboards reflect aesthetic sensitivity and creative drive.

    Forward-Thinking: You're always improving and expanding your capabilities‚Äîwhether it's adding new features, integrating smarter tech, or starting new ventures.
